# AL4PDE: A Benchmark for Active Learning for Neural PDE Solvers 

This repository contains the code for the paper, **Active Learning for Neural PDE Solvers**, introducing a modular and extensible active learning benchmark for time-dependent parametric PDE solving and comprises active learning algorithms, numerical solvers of parametric PDEs, and state-of-the-art neural operators.

Code availabe soon.
